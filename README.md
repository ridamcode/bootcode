# Bootcoding Practice Project

The Bootcoding Practice Project is a repository that contains practice exercises and coding challenges designed to improve your coding skills and problem-solving abilities. This README file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions on how to get started.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple directories, each containing a different coding challenge or exercise. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- `exercises/`: This directory contains individual exercises that focus on specific programming concepts or algorithms. Each exercise is provided with a detailed problem statement, example inputs and outputs, and a starter code file.

- `challenges/`: This directory contains more complex coding challenges that require you to apply various programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. Each challenge includes a problem description, sample inputs and outputs, and a starter code file.

- `solutions/`: This directory is intended for you to store your own solutions to the exercises and challenges. It's recommended to create a separate file for each solution and use clear filenames that indicate the exercise or challenge it corresponds to.

- `projects/`: This directory is intended for you to work on real time data projects to the .

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.

## Getting Started

To start practicing coding with the Bootcoding Practice Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bootcoding-developer/bootcoding-practice-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd bootcoding-practice-project
   ```

3. Choose an exercise or challenge from the `exercises/` or `challenges/` directory.

4. Read the problem statement and example inputs/outputs provided in the exercise or challenge's README file.

5. Open the starter code file for the selected exercise or challenge in your preferred code editor.

6. Implement your solution in the starter code file, applying appropriate programming concepts and algorithms.

7. Test your solution with the provided example inputs or additional test cases of your own.

8. Once you're satisfied with your solution, save the file in the `solutions/` directory using a clear and descriptive filename.

9. Repeat the process for other exercises or challenges of your choice.

## Contribution
